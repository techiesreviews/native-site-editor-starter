# Agent notes

This repository is a static website. The repository root is the site root, there is no build, and every file runs as it is. Keep it that way: no bundler, no `package.json`, no generated files. Check changes by serving the root (`python3 -m http.server`, then http://localhost:8000/) and looking at the page.

When editing through Native Site Editor's MCP server, the editor applies the same layout; read its `native-site://conventions` resource too. The Components chapter below is copied from those conventions; where this site's own notes contradict how components work, the conventions win.

## Layout

```
index.html                           /
about/index.html                     /about/
work/<slug>/index.html               /work/<slug>/
404.html                             the not-found page (Cloudflare serves it for unknown paths)
styles/site.css                      shared styles; @imports tokens, elements, layout, sections, utilities
components/components.js             the component loader
components/<tag>/<tag>.html          a component's template
components/<tag>/<tag>.css           its styles (optional)
images/                              images
robots.txt                           served as is
_redirects                           optional: `/old/ /new/ 301` lines (the editor writes it when a page moves)
.editor/config.json                  editor-only: { "site": { "name", "url" } }; the site never loads it
```

- Every `.html` file is a page, except under `components/` and files or folders whose name starts with `.` or `_`. `a/b/index.html` is `/a/b/`; any other `x.html` is `/x.html`. Prefer folders with `index.html`.
- Links and asset paths are root links: `href="/about/"`, `href="/about/#contact"`, `src="/images/studio-desk.svg"`. A section on the same page is `href="#work"`. They work on any host at a domain root and through any local server, not from `file://`.
- Images live in `images/` and are referenced as `/images/<file>`.

## Pages

Every page is a full document. Copy an existing page and change its head and `<main>`:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en-GB">
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
  <title>About · Larkspur Studio</title>
  <meta name="description" content="One sentence about this page.">
  <link rel="canonical" href="https://native-site-editor-starter-test.lexvd.workers.dev/about/">
  …favicon, theme-color and Open Graph tags as on the other pages…
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="/styles/site.css">
  <script type="module" src="/components/components.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
  <a class="skip" href="#main">Skip to content</a>
  <site-header></site-header>
  <main class="page" id="main">
    …sections…
  </main>
  <site-footer></site-footer>
</body>
</html>
```

- The `<title>` is the page title followed by ` · Larkspur Studio`; `og:title` repeats it. `<meta name="description">` and `og:description` match. `canonical` and `og:url` are the site URL plus the page's path; `404.html` has neither. The site is kept out of search results (`<meta name="robots" content="noindex">` on every page) because this is a test domain.
- JSON-LD (the organization and the website) is on the home page only.
- `<main>` keeps `id="main"`: each page carries its "Skip to content" link right before `<site-header>`, and the link points there. Its style is in the shared CSS (`styles/utilities.css`).
- Sections written straight into a page are `<section>` elements with shared classes: `hero flow`, `prose flow`, `contact flow` (see `styles/sections.css`). Inside them, `.btn` styles a link as a button: `<a class="btn" href="…">Label</a>`.

To add a page at `/services/`: create `services/index.html` from a copy of `about/index.html`, change the title, description, canonical, `og:*` URL and text, then link to it (for the main navigation, edit `components/site-header/site-header.html` and `site-footer.html`; every page picks it up).

## Components
A component is a custom element. **A new component is just its files**: its template, `components/<tag>/<tag>.html`, and, when it has styles of its own, the sibling `components/<tag>/<tag>.css`. Nothing is registered: the loader finds a component by its tag, on the live site as in the editor's preview, so neither `components.js` nor `site.css` keeps a list of tags. (The editor also reads a flat `components/<tag>.html`, but the loader looks only in the tag's folder.) The tag is lowercase with a hyphen and named by part: `section-…` for a page section, `card-…` for a card or other repeated item, `site-…` for the header and footer, `block-…` for anything else.

### Using a component
The template is shadow DOM markup; each `<slot name="…">` marks a part the page fills. A page uses the tag and fills each slot with one whole element carrying the `slot` attribute; what it holds without a `slot` attribute fills the unnamed `<slot>`:
```html
<section-hero>
  <p slot="eyebrow" class="eyebrow">Studio name</p>
  <h1 slot="title">A short, clear headline.</h1>
  <p slot="lead" class="lead">Who this is for and what they get.</p>
  <a slot="primary" href="/about/#contact">Get in touch</a>
</section-hero>
```
- Editing a component's template or CSS changes every page that uses it; what a page slots in belongs to that page.
- The header and footer are components with no slots: their nav links live in the template, so changing the nav is one edit. Each page puts the skip link, `<a class="skip" href="#main">Skip to content</a>`, before `<site-header>` as a plain link, so it works without JavaScript; its style lives in the shared CSS, not the header's.
- Components can use other components.

### The loader
`components/components.js` is the site's own loader, a dependency-free ES module every page loads. It keeps no list of tags: it finds the custom elements that are not defined yet (in the page, in what scripts add later and in each template it renders), fetches each tag's template, `components/<tag>/<tag>.html`, and its stylesheet, `components/<tag>/<tag>.css` when there is one, once, and defines the element. Every instance gets an open shadow root with, in order: the page's stylesheets (each `<link rel="stylesheet">` in its head), the component's CSS with the `::slotted()` twins added, and the template. It hides optional parts (below) and sets `aria-current="page"` on links in the shadow root that point at the current page. Until a component is defined, `styles/site.css` hides it (one `:not(:defined)` rule that covers every component, with no list of tags, under `@media (scripting: enabled)`), so nothing flashes unstyled and nothing is hidden with JavaScript off; a tag whose template cannot be loaded is left undefined with a console warning and marked `data-unloaded`, which shows its content as it is.

### Slots
- Each slot wraps one whole element, not a slot inside the element: `<slot name="title"><h2>Headline</h2></slot>`, not `<h2><slot name="title">Headline</slot></h2>`. The page's copy is the element itself, `<h2 slot="title">Headline</h2>`, so the page source shows real elements and a part the user removes from a page stays gone.
- What becomes a slot (the editor's Make component follows the same rule; write templates by hand the same way):
  - **Text:** each text element (a heading, `p`, `blockquote`, `figcaption`, an `li` outside a list, …) is one slot. Inline `a`, `strong`, `em` and `br` stay inside it as rich text.
  - **Links:** a link is a slot of its own only when it stands alone (a button link), not when it sits in a text element.
  - **Images:** every `<img>` and `<picture>`, whatever its alt text. Inline `<svg>` icons and CSS backgrounds stay fixed.
  - **Lists:** a `<ul>` or `<ol>` is one slot, `list`, edited as a rich list.
  - **A component inside it:** a nested instance is one whole slot (`<slot name="quote"><block-quote></block-quote></slot>`), so each page owns that instance and fills its slots. A slot holding `card-…` instances is an items slot instead (below).
  - **Repeated items** go in an items slot (below).
  - **Fixed:** what is the same on every page stays in the template around the slots: wrappers (`<div class="actions">`), icons, decoration.
- Names come from the role: the first heading is `title`, a paragraph `text`, then `image`, `link` and `list`, numbered on repeats (`text-2`). When parts share a role, each one's own class tells them apart (`<p class="eyebrow">` and `<p class="lead">` give `eyebrow` and `lead`).
- Give every slot a fallback of the element it takes: the editor reads what a slot holds (text, a link, an image or other content) from it. Put classes on the fallback element (`<p class="lead">`) so the page's copy keeps them.
- Optional parts need no marker. In a section component that the page fills at all, each slot the page leaves out is hidden with its fallback; a bare tag (`<section-hero></section-hero>`) shows every fallback. Other components show a missing slot's fallback. An element that holds slots, has no text of its own and whose slots all show nothing (a row of buttons) is hidden too.

### Cards and repeated items
- A repeated item (a card in a grid, a step, a quote in a row) is a component of its own, `card-…`, so every item has the same slots. The section holds the items in an **items slot**: the unnamed slot, or a slot whose fallback is `card-…` instances. Its fallback is one instance of the card, and the page's items are instances of it, each filling its own slots:
  ```html
  <section>
    <slot name="title"><h2>Recent work</h2></slot>
    <div class="cards">
      <slot><card-project></card-project></slot>
    </div>
  </section>
  ```
  ```html
  <section-work>
    <h2 slot="title">Recent work</h2>
    <card-project>
      <h3 slot="title"><a href="/work/fern-and-kettle/">Fern &amp; Kettle</a></h3>
      <p slot="body" class="body">A one-page site with a menu the owners change themselves.</p>
    </card-project>
    <card-project>…</card-project>
  </section-work>
  ```
- The editor's Add card adds a fresh instance of the items slot's card component, from no items up, and other blocks can be dropped into an items slot too. A named slot is an items slot only when its fallback is `card-…` instances, so name only cards `card-…`.
- A second group of items in one component gets a named items slot (`items-2`, or a name for what it holds, `services`), and its items carry that name: `<card-service slot="services">`.
- **Card links.** A card links to its page through a link slot (`<slot name="link"><a href="/work/">Read more</a></slot>`), or through its title: the title's whole content is one link (`<h3 slot="title"><a href="/work/fern-and-kettle/">Fern &amp; Kettle</a></h3>`), and the site's shared card link rule stretches that link over the whole card, in a `.cards` grid and in a component's items slot. It lives in the shared CSS because component CSS cannot reach a link inside slotted content (`::slotted()` reaches only the slotted element). Card components set `:host { position: relative; }` to bound it; other links in a card take `position: relative; z-index: 1` to stay clickable. There is no `stretched` class. The starter's rules in `styles/layout.css`:
  ```css
  .cards > * { position: relative; }
  .cards > * :is(h2, h3, h4, [slot="title"]) > a:only-child::after,
  :not(main, body, section, div) > * > [slot="title"] > a:only-child::after { content: ""; position: absolute; inset: 0; }
  .cards > * a:not(:is(h2, h3, h4, [slot="title"]) > a:only-child) { position: relative; z-index: 1; }
  :not(main, body, section, div) > :has(> [slot="title"] > a:only-child) a:not([slot="title"] > a:only-child) { position: relative; z-index: 1; }
  ```
- A card that is one link around everything (`<a class="card" href="…">…</a>`) becomes a card component without the wrapping link: its image and texts become slots and its title carries the link, as above. A link around no text at all is one whole slot.

### Variants
- A variant is a `data-*` attribute on an instance that CSS styles: `<section-split data-layout="image-left">`. Leaving it off gives the default look, so write the default look without the attribute and a rule for each other value; choosing the default in the editor removes the attribute.
- In the component's CSS, select it on the host: `:host([data-layout="image-left"]) { … }`, also inside `@media` and `@container`, and nested either way: `:host([data-layout="image-left"]) { .media { order: 2; } }` or `.media { :host([data-layout="image-left"]) & { order: 2; } }`. Never `:host[data-layout="…"]` or `:host { &[data-layout="…"] { … } }`: browsers never match them.
- A yes/no variant is styled by its presence (`:host([data-reverse])`) or by `"true"`/`"false"`. It is written bare on the instance (`<section-split data-reverse>`) when a rule matches its presence, and as `data-reverse="true"` when the CSS only matches `"true"`.
- Values are `=` matches (`[data-layout="centered"]`); other attribute operators make no variant. The editor reads the values from the CSS and labels them from the value (`image-left` reads "Image left", `data-layout` reads "Layout"), so no comments or annotations are needed. A value no rule knows stays on the page as it is.
- The site's shared CSS can add variants too: a rule naming the tag (`section-hero[data-layout="centered"]`, or nested `section-hero { &[data-layout="centered"] { … } }`) adds one to that component; `:host([data-x="v"])` in a shared stylesheet reaches every component through the loader; and a rule on the bare attribute (`[data-x="v"]`) is offered on every component (except `data-tone`, below).
- Suggested names, so components share them: `data-layout` (`content-left`, `image-left`, `centered`) and `data-tone` (below). Any other `data-*` name works. Leave `data-empty`, `data-unloaded` and `data-native-…` to the loader and the editor. An attribute the site's own scripts set (`data-open`) is state: the editor does not offer it as a variant when it is styled in the component's own CSS.
- Picking a variant is changing one attribute on the instance in the page (edit_file through the editor).

### Tones
Tones work this way where the site's CSS defines them (look for `[data-tone="…"]` rules in the shared CSS first); a site without them has none, so add them before using `data-tone`.
- `data-tone` colours a page band: a section component, a plain `<section>`, the header or the footer. Cards, buttons and everything else inside a band follow their band; there is no tone inside a toned band.
- Its values are `light` (the default: no attribute), `dark`, `brand` and `accent`.
- The tone rules live once, in the site's shared CSS, as plain `[data-tone="…"]` rules (never in a component's CSS), so a tone means the same on every band; written by hand, they work on any element.
- Tone rules should keep text readable (WCAG AA) whatever the brand colour:
  - `light` and `dark` set `color-scheme`, so the site's colour roles flip.
  - `brand` and `accent` take their surface from `--brand` with relative colour syntax: `brand` is the brand colour with its OKLCH lightness moved out of the middle band (to at most 0.50 or at least 0.72, hue and chroma kept); `accent` is a soft, light, low-chroma tint of it.
  - Text is `contrast-color()` of the surface under `@supports`, else a near-white or near-black picked from the surface's lightness. Buttons in a toned band invert (the fill takes the text colour, the label the surface colour); links take the text colour, underlined. Browsers without relative colour syntax get fixed fallback colours.
- So components colour themselves from the site's colour tokens, never fixed values (`color: #fff`), and follow the band they sit in. Changing `--brand` recomputes every band.

### Building a section component
- Root: exactly one `<section>`, with nothing before or after it. Only such templates are section components (get_site's `section: true`), which add_section and the page builder place between sections.
- In the CSS, write rules for the template's own elements (`h2 { … }`, `.lead { … }`, `.actions a { … }`) without `::slotted()`: the loader and the preview add each selector's `::slotted()` twin (`.actions a` also reads `.actions ::slotted(a)`), so one rule styles both the fallback and the element a page slots in. The twin reaches the slotted element itself, not elements inside it, and none is added for a selector whose last part has a pseudo-element (`a::after`), `:host` or `:has()`; write `::slotted(a)::after` by hand if needed.
- Inside the shadow root the page's stylesheets sit in their cascade layers and component CSS does not, so a component rule beats a shared rule on the template's own elements. On an element a page slots in, the page's CSS beats the component's `::slotted()` rules whatever the layers (styles from outside a shadow tree beat those inside it), so shared rules that size elements use `:not([slot])` (`h1:not([slot])`) to leave what a page slots in to the component. Both hold for declarations without `!important`, which reverses them.
- Use the site's design tokens (`var(--space-l)`, `var(--text-2xl)`, `var(--accent)`) from `styles/tokens.css`; read it and an existing component's CSS first.
- Through the editor, a section component goes into a page with add_section, never by hand-writing the instance. add_section writes the tag with a copy of each named slot's fallback that is one element holding only text and inline markup (a heading, `p`, `blockquote`, `figcaption`, `dt`, `dd`, `address`, or a link or other inline element) or one `<img>`, as that element with the `slot` attribute (`<h2 slot="title">Headline</h2>`); a fallback of text and inline markup that is not one element is copied inside a `<span slot="…">`. It copies nothing for the unnamed slot or for any other fallback (a list, a `<picture>`, a nested component or card, several elements that are not all inline): fill those in the page yourself, or the section hides them. Without the editor, write the instance the same way.
- Through the editor: write the template (and its CSS, if it has any), then place it with add_section and fill its copied parts with edit_file.

```html
<section>
  <slot name="eyebrow"><p class="eyebrow">Studio name</p></slot>
  <slot name="title"><h1>A short, clear headline.</h1></slot>
  <slot name="lead"><p class="lead">Who this is for and what they get.</p></slot>
  <div class="actions">
    <slot name="primary"><a href="/about/#contact">Get in touch</a></slot>
    <slot name="secondary"><a href="/work/">See our work</a></slot>
  </div>
</section>
```

## This site's components

- Component CSS is scoped to its shadow root, so use element selectors (`article`, `nav a`) and a short class only to tell same-tag siblings apart.
- The loader recomputes optional parts on `slotchange`. It leaves links containing `#` out of `aria-current`, so the header's Work link (`/#work`) is not marked. After components load, it scrolls again to the page's hash target unless the reader has scrolled meanwhile.
- `card-project` has `note`, `title`, `body` and `link` slots, plus an unnamed slot; use `body` for its description, as in the home page. Its empty `link` slot has no fallback, so the loader hides the link paragraph when no link is supplied.
- `card-project` passes its `note` slot through `card-note` with `<slot name="note" slot="text">`. Text forwarded through another component's slot is reached only by inheritance, so `card-note` sets its type on `:host`.
- `card-quote` has `title` and `body` slots, with no image or link slot; put a link inside its title to link the card.
- `card-project` supports `data-layout="centered"` to centre its text, note and link row; leaving it off keeps the default layout.

## Styles

`styles/site.css` sets the layer order and imports, in order: `tokens.css` (custom properties), `elements.css` (plain elements), `layout.css` (`.page`, `.flow`, `.cards`), `sections.css` (page sections: `.hero`, `.lead`, `.cta`, `.steps`, `.contact`; `.btn` for a link styled as a button, `<a class="btn" href="…">Label</a>`), `utilities.css` (`.skip` for the page's skip link, then `.text-s` … `.text-4xl`, which the editor's Text size writes). A new shared file is imported from `site.css`. Elements have no margins: text blocks take `flow`, components use `gap`.

In a `.cards` grid, a title whose only element is a link stretches that link over the whole item, whether a plain card or a card component. A card component's title link also stretches when the card sits in another component's items slot (`<section-work><card-project><h3 slot="title"><a …>`). That part of the rule goes by structure: it matches a slotted title whose component sits inside another component, so a non-card component nested in a named slot gets it too. The rule uses `:only-child`, which ignores text, so make the link the title's whole content. Card components (and any nested component with a title link) set `:host { position: relative; }` to bound it; other links stay clickable. A section component's own title link (its tag sits in `<main>`, `<body>`, a `<section>` or a `<div>`) and a card component on its own outside a `.cards` grid cover only the title. Whole-title links keep the heading's colour, with an underline on hover.

## Adding a blog

1. `blog/index.html`: a copy of `about/index.html` with a hero section and a list of posts, for example `<div class="cards">` of `<card-project>`s, each with `<p slot="note">` (date), `<h3 slot="title">`, `<p slot="body" class="body">` and `<a slot="link" href="/blog/<slug>/">Read</a>`, as in the home page's `#work` section.
2. `blog/<slug>/index.html` per post: a copy of `work/fern-and-kettle/index.html`, with the post in `<section class="prose flow">`. Set its title, description, canonical and `og:*` URL.
3. Add `<a href="/blog/">Blog</a>` to the nav in `components/site-header/site-header.html` (and the footer), which updates every page.

## Do not

- Add a build step, dependencies or generated output.
- Use hash routes (`#/about/`) or relative asset paths (`images/x.svg`); use root links.
- Put site files in `.editor/`, or editor settings anywhere else.
